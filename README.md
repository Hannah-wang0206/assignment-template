This is a simple application created with Streamlit that utilizes the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation to calculate the final velocity change ∆v of a rocket. This equation is fundamental in rocket science, describing the relationship between the change in rocket velocity and the rocket's mass, exhaust velocity, and the mass flow rate of the expelled propellant.

Parameter Input: Sliders or input boxes are provided for users to easily adjust the initial mass of the rocket, the exhaust velocity and burn time.

Real-time Feedback: As users adjust the parameters, the app should calculate and display the final velocity change ∆v of the rocket in real time.

Visualization: Use charts to illustrate the process of the rocket from launch to orbit, showing the velocity change of the rocket over time.
